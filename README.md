A Falling Ball Game which can be played by eSense Earables made with Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Introduction

So this project was done as part of an lecture at my university.
The task was to develop a flutter app using the eSense Earables.

Then I made a simple game with the scope that you must guide a ball to the end of an maze.
The control of the ball either happens with the gyrosensor within the phone or the Earables

Some of the used frameworks are:
- flame
- box2d_flame
- shared_preferences
- esense_flutter

In the future I might comment the code a bit more but I think this is a good starting point.
